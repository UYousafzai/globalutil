## Usage

## Example Use Case: Preparing Files for LLM Upload

When working with Large Language Models (LLMs), it's often useful to have all relevant files in a single location and to have a clear understanding of the project structure. Here's how you can use globalutil to prepare your files for LLM upload:

from local package
```python
from globalutil.filesystem import Inspect, Sort

# Collect all Python files into a single folder
structure = Inspect.generate_copy_structure("./", "./temp")
Sort.copy_structure(structure, patterns=["*.py"])

# Generate a tree structure of your project
tree = Inspect.get_directory_tree(".")
with open("tree.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(tree)
```


This code will:
1. Copy all .py files from the current directory and its subdirectories into a "./temp" folder.
2. Generate a tree structure of the current directory and save it to "tree.txt".

Now you have:
- All your Python files collected in the "./temp" folder, ready for easy upload to the LLM.
- A "tree.txt" file that provides a clear overview of your project structure, which you can also share with the LLM to give it context about your project organization.

This approach makes it easy to provide the LLM with both your code files and a structural overview of your project, enabling more informed and context-aware interactions.
